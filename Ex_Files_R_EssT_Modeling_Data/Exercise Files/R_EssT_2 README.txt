README
============================================================

This R project was created by Barton Poulson for the LinkedIn Learning course ÒR Essential Training, Part 2: Modeling Data.Ó This R project contains three folders:

1. CODE

The code folder contains the program files for this course. In this case, it consists of R scripts for every video that uses R code. In other situations, it could contain several other formats, as well.

2. DATA

The data folder contains all external data files that are used as examples in this course. (This course also relies on several datasets from the datasets package that is part of R, so those datasets are not included here.)

3. OUTPUT

The output folder is empty but can be used to save any images or other exportable files that result from the analyses.

In addition to these three folders, the following files are contained in the R_EssT_2 project folder:

- This README file.

- The R_EssT_2.Rproj file that contains all of the project settings and links for use in the desktop versions of RStudio.
