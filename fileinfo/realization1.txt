"Estimated that about 7500 ha occurs along the Murray River in NSW. This has been estimated by attributing 50% of section 1, 45% of section 2, 5% of section 3 and 5% of section 4 of the structural map unit Red Gum Forest as mapped in Margules & Partners (1990) and by correlating the sampling plot frequency along the River of floristic communities 3 and 4 described in Smith & Smith (1990). Additional areas for the Murrumbidgee River have been estimated. Miles (2001) estimates that 60% of Riverine vegetation along the Murray River remains. Some areas have been cleared on private land for cropping and grazing. Tree dieback becoming more common due to reduced rainfall and flooding."

After seed fall seedlings can establish where sufficient moisture is retained the soil after rain or floods. If flooding is reduced due to river regulation drought-like conditions will prevent tree recruitment. Extended flooding for over four months may kill small seedlings while taller ones may survive. Abundance of associate species varies depending on wetness of the site and the season. This community probably requires less regular flooding than ID2. Roots of River Red Gum seedlings must penetrate below a poorly aerated gley layer to a aerated clay layer in the soil profile to ensure their successful establishment (Pressey et al. 1984)." "Rarely subject to fire due to flooding and low ground biomass. Crown fires are rare due to the height of the trees and a lack of shrubs. Intense or even medium-intese fires may kill River Red Gum trees by burning to the tree's cambium at the base of the trees. These fires will also kill seedlings. River Red Gum cannot recover by sprouting from lignotubers. Fires in River Red Gum forests of the Murray River region have been recorded in summers after a lack of winter floods. It is possible that Aborigines lightly patch burnt the forest floor prior to European settlement."

The shrub layer is sparse or absent with Mountain Cedar Wattle (Acacia dealbata) sometimes present. The ground cover may be mid-dense or dense and is dominated by grass species such as snow grass Poa labillardieri, Blown Grass (Lachnagrostis filiformis) and Mat Grass (Hemarthria uncinata var. uncinata) along with sedges such as Carex tereticaulis, Carex inversa and Carex appressa and rushes such as Juncus amablis and Juncus subsecundus. Forb species include Ranunculus spp., Persicaria prostrata, Wahlenbergia fluminalis, Pratea concolor and Centipeda cunninghamii. Weed species may be common and include Bromus hordeaceus, Cirsium vulgare, Vulpia bromoides, Verbena officinalis, Hypochaeris radicata, Lolium perenne, Lolium rigidum and Cyperus eragrostis. Occurs on silty-sandy loam-clay soils on levees or other raised landform elements adjacent to rivers and wetlands. Mainly distributed along the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers with small areas on the Lachlan River in the temperate (hot summer) and semi-arid (warm) climate regions of south-western NSWand Victoria. Most common east of Deniliquin and replaced by other River Red Gum floristic types to the west of there. The main threats are dieback from extended drought and lack of flooding regimes due to reduced water flows and flooding, weed invasion and over-logging. Tree dieback from drought has increased since 2000." 5 "BioNet Vegetation Classification" 9000 "Approved"
